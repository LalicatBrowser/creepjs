CreepJS is an open source JavaScript library that can be used to detect and obtain various parameters and fingerprint information of browsers. Here are some browser parameters that CreepJS can detect:

1. User-Agent: contains browser, operating system and device information, which can be used to identify users.

2. Language Environment: The browser can detect the user's language settings, including preferred and alternate languages.

3. Browser Plugins: It can detect whether the user has installed specific browser plugins, such as Flash and Java.

4. Screen Resolution: It can detect the user's screen resolution and zoom ratio to determine the physical size of the display.

5. Time zone: It can detect the time zone where the user is located to determine the user's geographical location.

6. Target Object: The target object that can detect the user's last click or touch event on the page.

7. Browser Fingerprint: A unique browser fingerprint can be generated, which is composed of multiple parameters and information, and is used to identify and track users.

CreepJS can collect this information through JavaScript code and generate browser fingerprints. This information can be used to identify and track users, so if you wish to protect your privacy, you can use browser plug-ins or other tools to mask this information.
